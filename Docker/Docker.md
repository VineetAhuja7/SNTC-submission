I explored docker for first time and found such a great thing existed to share projects easily

# Task 2
Option 1 will be better as it saves my effort
we can do by creating a non-root access user and adding that user in dockergroup by:
1. Create the docker group
```
sudo groupadd docker
```
2. Add your user to the docker group.
```
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```
# TASK 3
Whenever we restart conatiner it gets a fresh start and changes in virtual system is gone so we mount the virtual system in container on host in physical system

we can use this command to create volume
```
docker run-v <directory_on_host:directory_in_container>
```
