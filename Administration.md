So now we can moniter  how the attacker can lead to superuser and check kernel version, application and services running with root server access

Also we can make honeypot for the server and later change credentials and permissions and log out for all admin so we and hacker both gets logged out
then deploy honeypot and check for damage and it will also help later in future hags
